- Order of entries in ls isn't right
- [Entry] shows w/ ls output instead of correct type
- ls -contains should include description matches after matching on name
- Misc fields added to yaml not supported
- Links not working properly (entry with links doesn't offer link menu item)
- Don't treat [brackets] that are immediately followed by a ( as an Entry link
- Replace [!404] with [?404] to avoid confusiong with ![image]
- Ctrl-C sometimes hangs
- Orphan links

Frontmatter/fields
- Add map[string]string Custom yaml field
- Add Address field to Place

Files/Images
- Trying to allow for linked docs and images without making it too fiddly
- Current:
    - Upload manually and name w/ entry tag + ### increment. 
    - Any desc or meta data handled in description/link
- Initial improvements: 
    - Add cmds to push and get files (memory addfile -name "Entry Name" - file /path/image.jpg)
- Further out:
    - Metadata for files: name (handled like Entry names), ext, description
        - Files
            - f1
                - Name: (if blank, uses entry name)
                - Description: Optional description for a file that is displayed in a table. 
                - Ext: png
            - tag2
                ...
        - Images
            - tag
- Allow for reference of images and files by index ![](0)
- Implement liquid template to support something like {% images %} and {% files %}
