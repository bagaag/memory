Files/Images
- Trying to allow for linked docs and images without making it too fiddly
- Current:
    - Upload manually and name w/ entry tag + ### increment. 
    - Any desc or meta data handled in description/link
- Initial improvements: 
    - Add cmds to push and get files (memory addfile -name "Entry Name" - file /path/image.jpg)
    - Add cmds to list, view, add and delete files from interactive prompt
    - Allow for reference of images and files by index ![](0)
    - Implement liquid template to support something like {% images %} and {% files %}
