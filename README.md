# Memory

This application is in early development. See the commit history for progress
updates.

Memory is a command line application that captures, stores and manages the data
that comprises human experience. Information is organized into people, places,
things and events. A network of relationships between them relays human
experience in a way that traditional journaling methods cannot.

Though intended to capture and preserve memory, it can also be used as a tool
for writing fiction, genealogical research or  historical study.
