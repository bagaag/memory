# Memory

Memory is a command line application that captures, stores and manages the data
that comprises human experience. Information is organized into people, places,
things and events. All of these can be related in meaningful ways to capture
and relay human experience in a way that traditional journaling methods cannot.

This application is in early development. See the commit history for progress
updates.
